The VOMDL standard has been design to offer a machine readable serialization for models. 
This feature is the basis of the design of this annotation syntax. 
It makes it working for any model
and therefore it is strongly recommended to build annotations from VODML resources.

IVOA model are released with the following resources
\begin{itemize}
    \item The standard specification (pdf)
    \item The VODML file specification (model-v1.vodml.xml)
    \item An HTML representation of the model. 
          This resources is generated from the VODML file by a style sheet.    
\end{itemize}

Both PDF and HTML are accessible through the standard landing page
on \url{https://ivoa.net/documents/index.html}.
VODML files are accessible from \url{https://ivoa.net/xml/index.html}.
