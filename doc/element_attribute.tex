The \texttt{ATTRIBUTE} element defines either a class attribute or a collection item, both set with atomic values.
The requirements on
the content (especially \texttt{@ref} and  \texttt{@dmrole}, may differ depending on
the usage:


\begin{enumerate}
\item Child of \texttt{INSTANCE}

 The \texttt{ATTRIBUTE} can be seen as a class attribute;
    it must have a \texttt{@dmrole} XML attribute.

In this case, the \texttt{ATTRIBUTE} must be specified by:
  \begin{itemize} 
      \item \texttt{@ref} - reference to a VOTable \texttt{PARAM} or \texttt{FIELD}
      \item \texttt{@value} - a literal
      \item  if both are provided; \texttt{@value} serves as the default 
      if the reference cannot be resolved
  \end{itemize}  

  
\item Child of \texttt{COLLECTION}

In this case the host \texttt{COLLECTION} can be seen as a vector and the \texttt{ATTRIBUTE} as one coordinate of the vector. 
It must have  no \texttt{@dmrole} XML attribute or an empty one.

In this case, the \texttt{ATTRIBUTE} must be specified by:
  \begin{itemize} 
      \item \texttt{@ref} - reference to a VOTable \texttt{PARAM} or \texttt{FIELD}
      \item \texttt{@value} - a literal
      \item if both are provided, \texttt{@value} serves as the default if 
      the reference cannot be resolved
  \end{itemize}  
              
\item Any case :

    The \texttt{ATTRIBUTE} must always have a non-empty \texttt{@dmtype} XML attribute.
    An \texttt{ATTRIBUTE} with a \texttt{@ref} pointing on a \texttt{FIELD} must be located in the \texttt{TEMPLATES} element
    mapping the table containing that field. \texttt{@ref} of \texttt{ATTRIBUTE}-s located in the \texttt{GLOBALS} block can only 
    point at \texttt{PARAM} since the \texttt{GLOBALS} element does not map any data table.
    
\end{enumerate}  
 
 MIVOT does not specify the way to handle NULL values. This remains in charge of the client implementation, 
 not of the syntax. The role of syntax is to tell the client how to build model instances. 
 If a \texttt{@ref} points onto a null \texttt{FIELD} value, the client has to set the corresponding model leaf 
 as NULL as well, but the way it do it is very specific to both language and implementation choices.

            If the attribute value is set by a resolved \texttt{@ref},

            Must be ignored if the native value is a single value. 
            An error must be risen if \texttt{@arrayindex} is out of range.
            This attribute is always optional.\\
