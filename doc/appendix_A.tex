This listing is issued from a Gaia light curve. It has been reworked out and mapped by hand 
in a way to provide examples of mapping patterns applied to real data.
The mapped models are the prototypes that were used in 2021 to develop the mapping syntax 
and the associated tooling.

Most of the XML snippets of the normative sections are taken out from this table. 
In this case, links connecting the text with the relevant locations in the listing have been setup.

The VOTabke below contains many comments explaining how mapping patterns must be interpreted.
