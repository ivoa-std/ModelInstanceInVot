NOTE: here are just the items risen by MCD in issue 95: must be merged with FB comments

The first block is describing the limitations of the utype approach.
\begin{itemize}
  \item not intended to be parsable, so only identifies what the leaf 
  FIELD/PARAM is, not its context.
  \item not reusable, the same element used in different contexts/models 
  have different utypes; which hinders interoperability
  \item onstrained to single-table serializations. All model elements must 
  be contained within the same VOTable TABLE.
  \item does not support annotating the VOTable content to multiple models 
  (as TimeSeries or Catalog/Source )
\end{itemize}

The second block doesn't mention that utypes are long, though they usually are.
\begin{itemize}
  \item "In VODML, the simple UType string identifying a model leaf, is replaced 
  by identifiers for the model element and for the role it plays in the parent
  object. As a consequence..."
\end{itemize}
