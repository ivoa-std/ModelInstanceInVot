The JOIN element allows to populate a COLLECTION with INSTANCEs from another collection, namely the foreign collection.
The foreign collection can either be a static element (GLOBALS/COLLECTION) or a collection of INSTANCES resulting from the iteration over a TEMPLATES.

The JOIN element must contain attributes identifying the foreign collection  (@sourceref and/or @dmref). 
It can have WHERE children stating the join condition.

It must be child of a COLLECTION that has no other children element than INSTANCE. A COLLECTION cannot host more than 1 JOIN.

JOIN may have 2 uses:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Join with TEMPLATES data:
       \begin{itemize}
         \item must have a @sourceref attribute identifying the foreign TEMPLATES
         \item may have a @dmref attribute to identify an INSTANCE within the foreign TEMPLATES.
       \end{itemize}
       The mapping of the enclosing COLLECTION items can be either implicit or explicit:
       \begin{itemize}
         \item If it has no other children, it must be populated with the whole table rows.
         \item Otherwise the item content is given by the enclosed INSTANCE. 
                 The reference (@ref) contained in those INSTANCEs must refer to te field of the foreign table.
       \end{itemize}
       
  \item Join with COLLECTION data:
       \begin{itemize}
         \item must have no @tableref attribute, because referencing a table in this case is irrelevant.
         \item must have a @dmref attribute to identify the COLLECTION to be joined with. This COLLECTION must be a GLOBALS child.
       \end{itemize}
       The mapping of the enclosing COLLECTION items can be either implicit or explicit:
       \begin{itemize}
         \item If it has no other children, it must be populated with the foreign collection items.
         \item Otherwise the item content is given by the enclosed INSTANCEs. The reference (@ref) contained in those INSTANCEs must refer to the field of the foreign table, we must not have such @ref if the foreign collection is static
       \end{itemize}
           
\end{itemize}
