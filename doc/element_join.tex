The JOIN element allows to populate a COLLECTION with INSTANCEs from another collection, namely the foreign collection.
The foreign collection can either be a static element (GLOBALS/COLLECTION) or a collection of INSTANCES resulting from the iteration over a TEMPLATES.

The JOIN element must contain attributes identifying the foreign collection  (@sourceref  and/or @dmref). 
It can have WHERE children stating the join condition.

It must be child of a COLLECTION that has no other children element than INSTANCE. A COLLECTION cannot host more than 1 JOIN.

JOIN may have 2 uses:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Join with TEMPLATES data:
       \begin{itemize}
         \item must have a @sourceref attribute identifying the foreign TEMPLATES
         \item may have a @dmref attribute the identify an INSTANCE within the foreign TEMPLATES.
         \item The mapping of the enclosing COLLECTION items can be either implicit or explicit:
         \begin{itemize}
             \item If it has no other children, it must be populated with the whole table rows. In this case the TEMPLATES must have one unique child 
                      since we cannot have collection items made of multiple instances
             \item Otherwise the item content is given by the enclosed INSTANCE which must be unique.
                     The reference (@ref) contained in that INSTANCE must only refer to fields of the foreign table.
         \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

       
  \item Join with COLLECTION data:
       \begin{itemize}
         \item must have no @sourceref  attribute, referencing a table in this case is irrelevant.
         \item must have a @dmref attribute the identify the COLLECTION to be joined with. This COLLECTION must be GLOBALS child.
         \item The mapping of the enclosing COLLECTION items can be either implicit or explicit:
         \begin{itemize}
             \item If it has no other children, it must be populated with the foreign collection items.
             \item Otherwise the item content is given by the enclosed INSTANCEs. The reference (@ref) contained 
                      in those INSTANCEs must refer to te field of the foreign table, we must not have such @ref if the foreign 
                      collection is static
       \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
