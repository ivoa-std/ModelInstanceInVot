The first purpose of a model is to provide, for a particular domain, a formal description of the quantities relevant to that domain and how they are related to each other.
The second purpose is to facilitate the interoperability between  different stakeholders involved in the domain. The interoperability consists in arranging exchanged data 
so that any client can understand it without taking care of its origin and thus the same code can process and compare data coming from different sources.  
In other words, the more faithful the data representation is to the model, the better the interoperability is.
The challenge for the VO is to build a compromise on the way to map various data on standard models.

We could imagine to develop a new data container specific for that  purpose but any solution that ignores the existing assets would be utterly useless and would have no chance of being accepted.
The model mapping solution must be based on VOTables since VOTable  \citep{2019ivoa.spec.1021O} is the standard VO data container.
Unfortunately, if the VOTables schema allows a very good description of tabular data, it is unable to render a data view that suits well a complex model.
In the case of simple DAL protocols, this limitation has been worked around by specifying the meta-data that must be present in the query responses; the model mapping is therefore defined by the standard.
This approach is no longer applicable for complex models such as CubeDM or Provenance for which the data tree may vary from an instance to another.

The elements on which we have to build the standard are the following: the data content is a priori unknown (e.g. TAP responses), it has to be mapped on models that are not defined yet and the whole in a VOTable context.
The standard must be able to bind native data with a model in a way that a model-aware software can see it as 
model instances while maintaining the possibility to access them in their original layout.

This is partially done with UTypes which may connect FIELDs or PARAMs with model leaves in the case of tree-like models. 
Unfortunately, there is no unique  way to build and parse UTypes in the context of complex models. 
UTypes are no more unambuiguous for patterns where e.g the same class is used in different location of the model or when the model contains loops. 
UTypes do not allow cross-table references either. 
%(NFB: Humm. Why ? )

The landscape has dramatically changed in 2016 when VODML \citep{2018ivoa.spec.0910L} became a recommendation. 
VODML is a meta-model that gives a standard way to express VO models and to make them machine-readable.
In VODML, model leaves are no longer identified by simple strings like UTypes do, but by the role they play in a given location in the model hierarchy.*
%(NFB : Hum not sure of that. Long Utypes are well appropriate for roles of a data peice, but not to distinguish instances)
As a consequence any annotation mechanism based on VODML and preserving the model hierarchy will be able  to provide a data representation faith to that model.

The main concept of this standard is to insert in VOTable resources XML blocks complying with the 
model structure and containing references to the actual data.
These blocks are designed in such a way that a model-aware client only has to make a copy of that structure and to resolve the references  
to build model instances. More generic model-unaware clients can just ignore them.
