mireille .toto.test 
Model Instances in VOTables (MIVOT) defines a syntax to map VOTable data on any model serialized in VO-DML.
MIVOT annotations are grouped in a single XML block located in the resource head. 
The annotations operate as a bridge between the data and the model. 
It can denote the way data are connected to each other as well as different tables can be joined together.
It is also able to carry data or meta-data that are missing in the VOTable.
The annotation block is made of bricks that facilitate both annotation process and model instance reconstruction. 
it has been designed so as not to alter the original VOTable content, thus limiting its impact on legacy clients.

\end{abstract}


\section*{Acknowledgments}
We would like to thank all the people who have contributed to this standard, starting with the VODML authors who have introduced the concepts developed here.
We would also like to thank all contributors of the source DM session that was held at Interop Paris 2019, as well as all members of the TDIG and the participants to the DM workshop we ran in Spring 2021 
who helped us to refine our use-cases .
Finally, we say a big thank you to the CDS members who spent time assessing the extent to which data annotation could improve services.
This acknowledgement does not mention individuals, as the list would be too long, especially if the many interns who contributed to the realization of this project were included.

\subsection{Role within the VO Architecture}

\begin{figure}[h]

% As of ivoatex 1.2, the architecture diagram is generated by ivoatex in
% SVG; copy ivoatex/archdiag-full.xml to archdiag.xml and throw out
% all lines not relevant to your standard.
% Notes don't generally need this.  If you don't copy archdiag.xml,
% you must remove archdiag.svg from FIGURES in the Makefile.

\section{Relation to VOTable}

The data model annotation will reside within the scope of a VOTABLE V1.1+.


\noindent \textbf{Location}

The mapping block:
\begin{itemize}
\item MUST be contained in a VOTable RESOURCE with \texttt{type="meta"}. This extra feature is consistent with VOTable xml schema RESOURCE type definition and doesn't require any modification in the xml schema.
\item which MUST be the first child of a RESOURCE with \texttt{type="results"}.
\item there MUST be no more than one mapping block per 'results' RESOURCE.
\end{itemize}

The scope of the mapping block is the whole content of the 'results' RESOURCE. \newline

\noindent \textbf{Namespace}

The mapping element must be isolated from the VOTable elements by a name space set as an attribute of the \texttt{VODML} element.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Mapping block in a VOTable},language=XML]
<VOTABLE xmlns="http://www.ivoa.net/xml/VOTable/v1.3" 
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" version="1.3">
  <RESOURCE type="results">
    <RESOURCE type="meta">
      <VODML xmlns="http://www.ivoa.net/xml/merged-syntax">
        ...
      </VODML>
    </RESOURCE>
    <TABLE name="myDataTable">
      ....
