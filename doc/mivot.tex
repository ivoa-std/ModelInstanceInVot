\begin{abstract}
Model Instances in VOTables (MIVOT) defines a syntax to map VOTable data to any model serizalized in VO-DML.
The annotation operates as a bridge between the data and the model.
It associates the column/param metadata from the VOTable to the 
data model elements (class, attributes, types, etc.) of a standardized IVOA data model, expressed in the Virtual Observatory Data Modeling Language (here after VO-DML).
It also brings up VOTable data or metadata that were possibly missing in the table metadata.

The data model elements are grouped in an independent annotation block complying with the MIVOT XML syntax.
This annotation block is added as an extra resource element at the top of the VOTable result resource. 
The MIVOT syntax allows to describe a data structure as a hierarchy of classes. It is also able to represent relations and composition between them.It can also build up data model objects by aggregating instances from different tables of the VOTable.

Missing metadata can also be provided using MIVOT, for instance by completing coordinate system description, or by providing curation tracing.

The annotation block is made of re-usable bricks that facilitate the development of tools on both client and server sides.
The adopted design does not alter the original VOTable content. 
The backward compatibility is preserved thanks to the limited impact of the annotations on legacy clients.
\end{abstract}


\section*{Acknowledgments}
We would like to thank all the people who have contributed to this standard, starting with the authors of the VO Data Modeling Language who have introduced the concepts developed here.
We would also like to thank all contributors of the "Source Data Model" session held at the Paris Interop Meeting in 2019, as well as all members of the IVOA Time Domain Interest Group and the participants to the Data Model workshop we ran in Spring 2021. All helped us to refine our use-cases.
We would like the thank the both funding projects (European Project ESCAPE, OVFrance) and agencies (CNRS-INSU).
Finally, we say a big thank you to all the colleagues who spent time for assessing how such an annotation procedure could improve their VO services.
This acknowledgement does not mention individuals, as the list would be too long, especially the many interns who contributed to this project.

% As of ivoatex 1.2, the architecture diagram is generated by ivoatex in
% SVG; copy ivoatex/archdiag-full.xml to archdiag.xml and throw out
% all lines not relevant to your standard.
% Notes don't generally need this.  If you don't copy archdiag.xml,
% you must remove archdiag.svg from FIGURES in the Makefile.

\section{Relation to VOTable}

The data model annotation will reside within the scope of a VOTABLE V1.1+.


\noindent \textbf{Location}

The mapping block:
\begin{itemize}
\item MUST be contained in a VOTable \texttt{RESOURCE} with \texttt{type="meta"}. 
      This extra feature is consistent with VOTable xml schema \texttt{RESOURCE} type definition 
      and doesn't require any modification in the xml schema.
\item MUST appear in the same parent \texttt{RESOURCE} as the mapped \texttt{TABLE}-s.
\item SHOULD appear before the \texttt{TABLE} to enable streaming of MIVOT-mapped records.
\item MUST be unique in the \texttt{RESOURCE} containing the data to be annotated.
\end{itemize}

The scope of the mapping block is the whole content its parent \texttt{RESOURCE}. \newline

\noindent \textbf{Namespace}

The mapping element must be isolated from the VOTable elements by a name space set 
as an attribute of the \texttt{VODML} element.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Mapping block in a VOTable},language=XML]
<VOTABLE xmlns="http://www.ivoa.net/xml/VOTable/v1.3"

\section{Changes from Previous Versions}
\begin{itemize}
\item The standards has been published as an IVOA WD under the MIVOT name in April 2022 
      (\url{https://ivoa.net/documents/MIVOT/20220407/index.html}). 
      Since that time, most of the changes were focused on the unite tests, the text and the client code.
\item June 2022 (PR \#124): The \texttt{dm-mapping:} prefix in MIVOT element has been dropped. 
\item December 2022 (PR \#173): Allow \texttt{ATTRIBUTE} located in the \texttt{GLOBALS} block 
      to refer to VOTable \texttt{PARAM}. 
\item December 2022 (MR \#174): More flexible location of the MIVOT block.
      It must be enclosed in a \texttt{RESOURCE@type=meta} which must be 
      enclosed in another \texttt{RESOURCE}.
\item January 2023 : 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item (PR \#179) Refine the allowed locations for the MIVOT block according to the issue \#176.
		\item (PR \#184): Add appendix E (MIVOT and the registry).
		\item (PR \#185): Add some clarification on the client API, the TAP implementation and the NULL value for attributes.
	\end{itemize}

\item March 2023 : 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item (PR \#187): Tell how dmrole are built.
        \item (PR \#189): set more details in some snippet captions.
        \item (PR \#190): Add appendix F (Using VOMDL resources).
    \end{itemize}

The latest can however be traced from GitHub.
