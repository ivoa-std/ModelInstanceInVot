\begin{abstract}
Model Instances in VOTables (MIVOT) defines a syntax to map the column metadata from the VOTable format to the various 
data model elements (class, attributes, types, etc.) of a standardized IVOA data model expressed in the standard Virtual Observatory Data Modeling Language (here after VO-DML).
The data model elements used to interpret the data are conveyed in an independent annotation block in the MIVOT XML syntax.
This annotation block is added as an extra resource element at the top of the VOTable document. 
The MIVOT syntax allows to describe the data structure as classes, but also to show bindings and relations between them in one single table. 
It can also build up data model objects from joins operated on columns from different tables stored in the VOTable.
%It can denote the way data are connected to each other as well as different tables can be joined together.
%It is also able to carry data or meta-data that are missing in the VOTable.
Missing metadata can also be provided using MIVOT, for instance by completing coordinate system information, links to reference vocabulary, etc.
% to be confirmed 
The annotation block is made of bricks that facilitate both the annotation process on the data provider's side. 
These bricks are reused as well on the client side in order to generate data model instances.
The adopted design does not alter the original VOTable content, thus limiting its impact on legacy clients for backward compatibility.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
We would like to thank all the people who have contributed to this standard, starting with the authors of the VO Data Modeling Language  who have introduced the concepts developed here.
We would also like to thank all contributors of the "Source Data Model" session held at the Paris Interop Meeting in  2019, as well as all members of the IVOA Time Domain Interest Group and the participants to the Data Model workshop we ran in Spring 2021, who helped us to refine our use-cases.
Finally, we say a big thank you to the CDS members who spent time for assessing how such an annotation procedure could improve CDS  services for the VO.
This acknowledgement does not mention individuals, as the list would be too long, not to mention the many interns who contributed to this project.

The words ``MUST'', ``SHALL'', ``SHOULD'', ``MAY'', ``RECOMMENDED'', and
``OPTIONAL'' (in upper or lower case) used in this document are to be
interpreted as described in IETF standard RFC2119 \citep{std:RFC2119}.

The \emph{Virtual Observatory (VO)} is a
general term for a collection of federated resources that can be used
to conduct astronomical research, education, and outreach.
The \href{http://www.ivoa.net}{International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA)} is a global
collaboration of separately funded projects to develop standards and
infrastructure that enable VO applications.

% As of ivoatex 1.2, the architecture diagram is generated by ivoatex in
% SVG; copy ivoatex/archdiag-full.xml to archdiag.xml and throw out
% all lines not relevant to your standard.
% Notes don't generally need this.  If you don't copy archdiag.xml,
% you must remove archdiag.svg from FIGURES in the Makefile.

\section{Relation to VOTable}

The data model annotation will reside within the scope of a VOTABLE V1.1+.


\noindent \textbf{Location}

The mapping block:
\begin{itemize}
\item MUST be contained in a VOTable RESOURCE with \texttt{type="meta"}. This extra feature is consistent with VOTable xml schema RESOURCE type definition and doesn't require any modification in the xml schema.
\item which MUST be the first child of a RESOURCE with \texttt{type="results"}.
\item there MUST be no more than one mapping block per 'results' RESOURCE.
\end{itemize}

The scope of the mapping block is the whole content of the 'results' RESOURCE. \newline

\noindent \textbf{Namespace}

The mapping element must be isolated from the VOTable elements by a name space set as an attribute of the \texttt{VODML} element.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Mapping block in a VOTable},language=XML]
<VOTABLE xmlns="http://www.ivoa.net/xml/VOTable/v1.3" 
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" version="1.3">
  <RESOURCE type="results">
    <RESOURCE type="meta">
      <VODML xmlns="http://www.ivoa.net/xml/merged-syntax">
        ...
      </VODML>
    </RESOURCE>
    <TABLE name="myDataTable">
      ....
    </TABLE>
  </RESOURCE>
