The \texttt{GLOBALS} block holds singular data model instances, and is not associated 
with a particular VOTable \texttt{TABLE} element.

The contained instances have a global scope, and may be
referenced by other instances anywhere in the mapping block.  \texttt{INSTANCE} attributes
within the \texttt{GLOBALS} scope may only refer to VOTable \texttt{PARAMS} or contain
explicit values, they MUST NOT refer to VOTable \texttt{FIELDS}.  \\ 
Note: This rule is not enforced via the MIVOT XSD schema which is restricted to the control of the mapping block only.

Related instances may be grouped within a \texttt{COLLECTION} block to enable selection
via the ORM elements provided in this syntax.  See \texttt{COLLECTION} subsection for more details.
