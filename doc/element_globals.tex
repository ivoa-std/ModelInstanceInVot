The \texttt{GLOBALS} block holds model instances or collections of model instances 
that are not connected with any table column. 

The instances or collections contained in \texttt{GLOBALS} have a global scope. They can be
referenced by other instances anywhere in the mapping block.  
They must only contain literal values or reference to \texttt{PARAM} elements.
They must not refer to VOTable \texttt{FIELD} element.  \\ 

Related instances may be grouped within \texttt{COLLECTION} blocks to enable selection
via the MIVOT \texttt{JOIN} mechanism.  
See \texttt{COLLECTION} subsection for more details.
