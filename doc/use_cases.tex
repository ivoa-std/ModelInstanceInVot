The ultimate goal of this standard is to allow clients to understand complex data whether it is legacy or set for a particular model. It is however important not to force client developers  to choose between a regular table data extraction process and a full object oriented approach. Both ways should be allowed for the same data file.

The design of the mapping syntax addresses the necessity of supporting intermediate levels of use that correspond to concrete use cases.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The recent modeling efforts (Meas, Coords and PhotDM) provide very accurate descriptions of coordinate frames or photometric 
        systems that need to be serialised in VOTables:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Clients often need to get such coordinate systems descriptions upon different axes to properly display datasets. 
    \item Data sets can contain different quantities expressed in the
    same coordinate system (corrected position vs.~raw position) or 
          quantities of the same nature but expressed in different
          systems (sky coordinates in ICRS vs.~Gal). 
          This is partially supported by the actual VOTable schema (TIMESYS, COOSYS) but any change in these ad-hoc mapping 
          elements or the addition of any other elements (e.g. definition of X-ray energy band) would require VOTable version upgrades. 
          Using the mapping syntax disconnects the level of description of the different axes from the VOTable schema.           
  \end{itemize} 
  
  \item Quantities made with multiple components (spread over multiple table columns) may need to be aggregated by the client to be used correctly:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item value-error associations
    \item error quantities spread over several columns (covariance matrices). 
    \item quantities with quality flags
    \item positions with proper motions and/or parallaxes to compute error ellipses or positions at a given epoch
  \end{itemize} 

  \item The above cases relate to the description of instances in a
  single VOTable. Model annotations become even more important in cases
  where interoperability is required, for example to identify and
  reconcile quantities from multiple VOTables.

  This can be achieved by giving  common data structures for all 
  quantities of interest. This is the purpose of e.g. Measure model 
  which provides classes for most of the physical quantities that can 
  be rendered by the mapping syntax. Measure classes are not meant to 
  be used as standalone elements but as parts of host models 
  (e.g., Cube DM, MANGO DM);
  however, clients are free to either process those host models as a
  whole or to chase individual components.
  
  With more precise information on coordinate systems in the annotation:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Cross matching sources in VOTables containing the same
      quantities, e.g., the sky position, becomes easier.
            The reliability of the process is improved since the engine does not need to infer information that is not present in the FIELD metadata.
      \item Building SEDs from datasets that have the same photometric calibration representation becomes straightforward.
   \end{itemize}          

  \item In more advanced cases, we need to be able to extract complete model instances from VOTables.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Extracting  TimeSeries instances to feed into software built upon classes generated from that model.
      \item Building model instances that can be serialised in another
      format (e.g., json) in order to be shared in another context than 
            the VOTable processing (e.g. via SAMP).
   \end{itemize}         
    
   \item MIVOT can be used to annotate static science products such as e.g. time-series. It can also be used to annotate 
    TAP responses on the fly, as shown by \cite{2201.01732}. Note that this process relies on the correct execution of the TAP query 
    with respect to the database content and may fail due to missing searched columns, illegal joins, or bad data aggregation, for instance.
