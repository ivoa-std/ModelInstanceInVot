    The REFERENCE element is used to specify a reference relation to an INSTANCE.
    There are 2 usages for this element.
      1) Child of INSTANCE
         - must have non-empty dmrole, specifying the role the referenced INSTANCE plays in the referencing  INSTANCE.

      2) Child of COLLECTION, as list of references.
       - must have no or empty dmrole
         * dmrole is inherited from the parent COLLECTION

    There are 2 variations of this element.
      A) Simple reference to INSTANCE
         - must have non-empty dmref
         - must not have tableref
         - must not contain FOREIGN_KEY

      B) Referencing an instance based on selection criteria, either from VOTable::TABLE or COLLECTION.
         - must have tableref, identifying the COLLECTION or TABLE from which to select the referenced INSTANCE.
         - must have one or more FOREIGN_KEYs identifying the field on which to select.
