# Model components

This folder contains some MIVOT instances that can be used as bricks for data annotation.
- These components have been generated by a script (not public yet) and patched by hand sometimes.
- The components enclose defintions read from within the VODML an some other comment written by the generator ot help users.

## @ref vs @value

`ATTRIBUTE` have usually one `@ref="@@@@@"` and one `@value=""`.
- If the attribute value is a literal `@ref="@@@@@"` ca be dropped and the `@value=` must be set with that literal value.
  In this case, the `ATTRIBUTE` can be in an `INSTANCE` located in any MIVOT section (`GLOBALS` or `TEMPLATES`) since its 
  value does no depends on any table row.
- If the attribute value is to be set with the table row cell, `@ref=` must be set with the identifier of the column (ID or name).
  In this case,  the `ATTRIBUTE` must be in an `INSTANCE` located in the `TEMPLATES` mapping the table containing the referenced column.
  `@value=""` can be dropped if there is a `@ref`.
- If both `@ref` and `@value=` are present, `@value=` will be taken only if the colmun reference cannot be resolved.
  `@unit=` is usualy used to for the quantities set by `@value`. When it used with a `@ref` it must comply with `FIELD@unit`.


## Filter values

There is not component specific for given filters but just a templates.
Those will come later when SVO will be able to generated MIVOT serializations on the fly.
